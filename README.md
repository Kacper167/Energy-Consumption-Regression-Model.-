# Energy-Consumption-Regression-Model.
End-to-end time-series forecasting pipeline with engineered temporal features, Ridge regression, and coefficient stability analysis.
# Energy Consumption Prediction (Regression)

ML-focused project building a time-series regression pipeline to predict energy consumption using historical data and engineered features.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a structured, reproducible machine learning workflow:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Time-series feature engineering (rolling & lag features)  
- Handling missing values  
- Regression model training (Ridge)  
- Model evaluation and stability analysis  

The project emphasizes **engineering robust data pipelines and feature design** rather than business analytics.

## Feature Engineering

Key engineered features:

- Rolling statistics (mean, std)  
- Lagged percent changes  
- Cyclical time encodings (sin/cos for hour, day, week)  
- Expanding statistics (mean, std)  
- Log transformations  

Missing values generated by rolling and lag operations were handled before training.

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Model Evaluation

The Ridge regression model was validated using **time-series cross-validation**. Metrics:

- R²: ~0.88  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Coefficient stability across folds  

Key insights:  
- Recent consumption trends are the strongest predictors  
- Time-based features improve short-term forecast accuracy
